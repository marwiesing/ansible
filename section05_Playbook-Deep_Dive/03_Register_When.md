### Introduction
In this video, we explore the **register** directive in Ansible and its interplay with the **when** directive. These concepts help us capture output from executed modules and make decisions dynamically based on the results.

Topics covered include:
- Using the `register` directive to store output from tasks.
- Accessing and working with registered output.
- Handling variations in module output.
- Filters and conditions associated with registered content.
- Advanced use of the `when` directive.

Throughout, we'll build on foundational concepts using practical examples.

### **Using the `register` Directive**

#### **Command-Line Example**
The `ansible` ad-hoc command-line utility allows quick experimentation with modules like `command`. For instance:

```bash
ansible all -m command -a "hostname"
```
This runs the `hostname` command across all hosts, returning results to standard output.

#### **Playbook Example**
To leverage this in a playbook with the `register` directive:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Capture hostname output
      command: hostname -s
      register: hostname_output
```
Running this playbook:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yaml
```
outputs the following:

```yaml
ok: [host1]
changed: [host2]
```
The task executes and stores the results in `hostname_output`. To see the full content:

```yaml
- name: Show registered output
  debug:
    var: hostname_output
```
#### **Accessing Registered Data**
The `debug` module reveals detailed information about `hostname_output`, including:
- **Command execution details** (`cmd`, `start`, `end`).
- **Standard output** (`stdout`) and errors (`stderr`).
- **Exit code** (`rc`), where `0` signifies success.
- **Convenience keys** (`stdout_lines`) for line-by-line processing.

#### **Example: Extracting Hostname**
To isolate the hostname:

```yaml
- name: Display hostname
  debug:
    var: hostname_output.stdout
```
This filters the `stdout` field, extracting only the hostname value.

### **The `when` Directive**
The `when` directive enables conditional task execution. Below are incremental examples demonstrating its capabilities.

#### **Single Condition**
```yaml
- name: Run only on CentOS 8
  command: hostname
  when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS" and ansible_distribution_major_version == "8"
```
This task runs only on hosts with CentOS 8.

#### **Combining Conditions**
To handle multiple distributions:

```yaml
- name: Handle CentOS and Ubuntu
  command: hostname
  when: (ansible_distribution == "CentOS" and ansible_distribution_major_version == "8") or
        (ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu" and ansible_distribution_major_version == "20")
```
Here, parentheses group conditions, improving readability.

#### **Future-Proofing with Integer Comparisons**
When supporting future versions:

```yaml
- name: Handle newer versions
  command: hostname
  when:
    - ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
    - ansible_distribution_major_version | int >= 8
```
This ensures compatibility with CentOS 8 and above.

#### **Using Lists for `and` Conditions**
The `when` directive implicitly interprets lists as `and` conditions:

```yaml
- name: Simplified condition
  command: hostname
  when:
    - ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
    - ansible_distribution_major_version | int >= 8
```

### **Combining `register` and `when`**

#### **Conditional on Registered Data**
Registered data can control task execution dynamically. For example:

```yaml
- name: Capture hostname
  command: hostname
  register: command_register

- name: Install patch when changed
  yum:
    name: patch
    state: present
  when: command_register.changed
```
The task installs a package if the previous command modified the system.

#### **Checking for Skipped Hosts**

```yaml
- name: Install patch when skipped
  apt:
    name: patch
    state: present
  when: command_register is skipped
```
This runs a task on hosts where the prior command was skipped.

#### **Using `is` for Clean Syntax**
The `is` directive simplifies conditions:

```yaml
- name: Check for changes
  yum:
    name: patch
    state: present
  when: command_register is changed
```
This cleaner approach ensures readability.

### **Handling Variations in Output**
Modules may return inconsistent output keys (e.g., `skipped`, `failed`). To manage this, focus on consistent fields like `changed` or `stdout`.

Example:
```yaml
- name: Handle varied output
  command: hostname
  register: command_output

- name: Debug command result
  debug:
    msg: "Task skipped" if command_output.skipped else "Task changed"
```

---

### **Complete Example Playbook**
Combining concepts into a robust playbook:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Capture hostname
      command: hostname -s
      register: hostname_output

    - name: Debug registered output
      debug:
        var: hostname_output.stdout

    - name: Install patch if changed
      yum:
        name: patch
        state: present
      when: hostname_output.changed

    - name: Handle skipped hosts
      apt:
        name: patch
        state: present
      when: hostname_output is skipped
```

### **Key Takeaways**
- The `register` directive captures detailed output from modules, enabling dynamic decision-making.
- The `when` directive supports simple and complex conditions for precise control.
- Combining `register` and `when` unlocks powerful automation capabilities.
- Consistent fields like `changed` ensure reliable logic even with varied module outputs.
