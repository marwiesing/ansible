### **Section 6: Structuring Ansible Playbooks**
Welcome to Section 6 of the course, where we will focus on **Structuring Ansible Playbooks**. This section is pivotal in understanding how to create modular and maintainable playbooks. By the end of this section, you will know how to use includes, imports, tags, and roles effectively in your Ansible workflows.

---

### **Overview of the Section**
In this section, we will cover:
1. **Using Includes & Imports** – Learn the differences between dynamic and static task inclusion.
2. **Using Tags** – Discover how to execute specific parts of a playbook.
3. **Introducing Ansible Roles** – Understand how to convert existing playbooks into roles for better reusability and organization.

### **Video 1: Using Includes & Imports**
In this video, we will explore:
- **`include_tasks`**
- **`import_tasks`**
- **The difference between dynamic and static inclusions**
- **`import_playbook`**

These directives allow you to split tasks or even playbooks into separate files, promoting modularity and reuse. For example:
- Installing prerequisite packages can be moved into a separate file to simplify the main playbook.
- A `debug` module can output messages from an included playbook, showcasing modular execution.

#### **Example 1: Including Tasks Dynamically with `include_tasks`**
Imagine a scenario where you have a main playbook that requires installing specific software:
```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Display initial message
      debug:
        msg: "Starting main playbook"

    - include_tasks: install_packages.yaml
...
```
The `install_packages.yaml` file might look like this:
```yaml
---
- name: Install nginx
  yum:
    name: nginx
    state: present

- name: Install git
  yum:
    name: git
    state: present
...
```
When you run the playbook, tasks in `install_packages.yaml` are dynamically included at runtime.

---

#### **Example 2: Static Inclusion with `import_tasks`**
Static inclusions differ from dynamic ones in that they are pre-processed before execution. This can be useful when strict task ordering is required.
```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Import tasks
      import_tasks: install_packages.yaml
...
```
Here, `import_tasks` pre-processes the tasks, ensuring they are evaluated before execution begins.

---

### **Static vs. Dynamic Behavior**
1. **`import_tasks` (Static)**:
   - Tasks are pre-processed during the parsing phase.
   - The `when` condition is evaluated individually for each task.
2. **`include_tasks` (Dynamic)**:
   - Tasks are processed during playbook execution.
   - The `when` condition is evaluated once for the entire inclusion.

#### **Visualizing the Difference**
Consider the following playbook:
```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Test include_tasks
      include_tasks: dynamic_tasks.yaml
      when: dynamic_var is not defined

    - name: Test import_tasks
      import_tasks: static_tasks.yaml
      when: static_var is not defined
...
```
- In `include_tasks`, the condition is evaluated once before processing all tasks in `dynamic_tasks.yaml`.
- In `import_tasks`, the condition is checked for each task in `static_tasks.yaml`.

---

### **Example 3: Conditional Inclusion**
When combining `include_tasks` or `import_tasks` with conditions, you can control execution based on variables:
- `dynamic_tasks.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  ---
  - set_fact:
      dynamic_var: "defined"

  - name: Dynamic Task 2
    debug:
      msg: "This runs dynamically"
  ...
  ```
- `static_tasks.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  ---
  - set_fact:
      static_var: "defined"

  - name: Static Task 2
    debug:
      msg: "This runs statically"
  ...
  ```

---

### **Using `import_playbook`**
The `import_playbook` directive allows you to include entire playbooks. This is useful for combining multiple smaller playbooks into a master playbook.

#### **Example: Master Playbook**
```yaml
---
- import_playbook: setup_database.yaml
- import_playbook: setup_application.yaml
...
```
Each playbook (`setup_database.yaml` and `setup_application.yaml`) can be independently tested and reused.

### **Key Differences Recap**
| Feature                 | `include_tasks`         | `import_tasks`         | `import_playbook`         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Dynamic or Static**   | Dynamic                | Static                 | Static                    |
| **Scope**               | Tasks only             | Tasks only             | Entire playbook           |
| **When Condition**      | Evaluated once         | Evaluated for each task| Evaluated for each task   |
| **Use Case**            | Runtime task execution | Pre-processed tasks    | Modular playbooks         |

---

### **Best Practices**
1. Use **`include_tasks`** for tasks that depend on runtime variables or conditions.
2. Use **`import_tasks`** when task execution order and pre-parsing are crucial.
3. Use **`import_playbook`** to structure large playbooks into reusable components.
