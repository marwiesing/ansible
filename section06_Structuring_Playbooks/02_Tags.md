# **Using Tags in Ansible**

## **Introduction**

In this session, we will explore **tags** in Ansible, including how to:

1. Achieve **segmentation** with tags.
2. **Execute** specific parts of a playbook.
3. **Skip** tasks or sections using tags.
4. Work with **playbook-wide tags**.
5. Understand **special tags** like `always`.
6. Learn about **tag inheritance** with includes and imports.

Tags are particularly useful for **large, complex playbooks** or **playbooks that include other playbooks**. They allow selective execution of tasks, saving time and resources. Let’s walk through an example playbook and see how tags make it easier to manage.

## **Example Playbook: Nginx Deployment**

The example playbook is designed for deploying and configuring an Nginx application on both CentOS and Ubuntu. It includes tasks such as installing the EPEL repository, installing and restarting Nginx, and deploying an application. Here’s how tags can improve the playbook.

### **Defining Tags**

Tags can be added to individual tasks or entire plays. In our playbook:

- **install-epel**: Installs the EPEL repository (CentOS-specific).
- **install-nginx**: Installs the Nginx package.
- **restart-nginx**: Restarts the Nginx service.
- **deploy-app**: Deploys the application files.

Here’s an excerpt from the playbook:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Install EPEL
    yum:
      name: epel-release
      state: latest
    when: ansible_distribution == 'CentOS'
    tags:
      - install-epel

  - name: Install Nginx
    package:
      name: nginx
      state: latest
    tags:
      - install-nginx

  - name: Restart nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: restarted
    tags:
      - restart-nginx

  - name: Deploy application files
    template:
      src: index.html.j2
      dest: /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
    tags:
      - deploy-app
```

---

## **Running Playbooks with Tags**

1. **Executing Specific Tags**

To execute tasks with a specific tag, use the `--tags` option:

```bash
ansible-playbook nginx_playbook.yaml --tags install-epel
```

This runs the `install-epel` task for CentOS hosts while skipping others. The output confirms that only the EPEL installation task was executed.

2. **Combining Multiple Tags**

You can run tasks associated with multiple tags by separating them with commas:

```bash
ansible-playbook nginx_playbook.yaml --tags install-nginx,restart-nginx
```

This command installs and restarts Nginx, skipping all unrelated tasks.

---

## **Skipping Tags**

If you want to run the playbook but skip certain tasks, use the `--skip-tags` option:

```bash
ansible-playbook nginx_playbook.yaml --skip-tags deploy-app
```

This executes all tasks except those tagged with `deploy-app`.

---

## **Special Tags**

### **Default Behavior**

By default, all tasks are assigned the `all` tag. To view tasks associated with this tag:

```bash
ansible-playbook nginx_playbook.yaml --tags all
```

This includes every task unless specific tags or skip directives are used.

### **The `always` Tag**

The `always` tag ensures a task runs regardless of the tags specified during execution. For example:

```yaml
- name: Restart nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
  tags:
    - always
```

Running the playbook with specific tags, like `install-nginx`, will still execute the `restart-nginx` task because it’s tagged `always`.

To skip even `always` tasks, use:

```bash
ansible-playbook nginx_playbook.yaml --skip-tags always
```

---

## **Playbook-Wide Tags**

Tags can also be applied to an entire play. This is helpful when a playbook has multiple plays, and you want to control execution at a higher level.

Example:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  tags:
    - webapp
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      package:
        name: nginx
        state: latest
      tags:
        - install-nginx
```

Running the playbook with:

```bash
ansible-playbook nginx_playbook.yaml --tags webapp
```

Executes the entire play, including tasks without specific tags.

### **Impact on Fact Gathering**

Applying tags to a play can unintentionally skip the `gather_facts` task, which by default is tagged `always`. To avoid this:

1. Add a dedicated play for fact gathering:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes
```

2. Execute the playbook as usual. Facts will be gathered before tagged tasks run.

---

## **Tag Inheritance**

Tags can be inherited when using `include_tasks`, `import_tasks`, or `import_playbook`. For example:

```yaml
tasks:
  - include_tasks: setup.yaml
    tags:
      - setup
  - import_tasks: deploy.yaml
    tags:
      - deploy
```

When running the playbook with:

```bash
ansible-playbook main_playbook.yaml --tags deploy
```

Only tasks within `deploy.yaml` are executed.

---

## **Testing and Debugging with Tags**

To debug tag behavior:

- Use the `--list-tasks` option to preview all tasks and their tags:
  
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook nginx_playbook.yaml --list-tasks
  ```

- Use `--list-tags` to see all defined tags:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook nginx_playbook.yaml --list-tags
  ```

This helps verify tag assignments before running the playbook.

---

## **Practical Scenarios**

1. **Selective Configuration**: When updating a single component of your infrastructure (e.g., only deploying the application).
2. **Partial Testing**: Test a subset of tasks without running the entire playbook.
3. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate selective task execution for deployment pipelines.

---

## **Conclusion**

Tags offer flexibility and control in managing complex playbooks, making them essential for scalable and maintainable automation. By understanding and effectively using tags, you can streamline deployments and reduce execution times.
