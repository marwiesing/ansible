### **Section Overview: Using Ansible with Cloud Services and Containers**

Hello, and welcome to this section, where we’ll explore using **Ansible** to manage **cloud services** and **containers**. This section is relatively light in content but covers two exciting topics:

1. **AWS with Ansible**  
2. **Docker with Ansible**

Let’s dive into the first video of this section: **AWS with Ansible**.

---

### **Video: AWS with Ansible**

In this video, we’ll:
- Configure Ansible for AWS.
- Use Ansible to create and manage AWS EC2 instances.
- Set up **Dynamic Inventory** for AWS.
- Deploy a web application across **20 EC2 instances**.
- Finally, terminate the AWS resources to avoid unnecessary costs.

---

### **AWS Modules in Ansible**

Ansible’s AWS modules leverage Python’s **Boto** and **Boto3** libraries. These libraries provide robust functionality to interact with AWS services like EC2, S3, VPC, and more. To follow along, you’ll need:
- **An AWS account**: You can use the **AWS Free Tier**, which provides a limited number of resources free for 12 months.
- **Budgeting awareness**: Review AWS pricing and set up **budgeting alerts** to monitor costs.

> **Pro Tip**: Leaving resources like EC2 instances running could result in unexpected costs. Always verify that resources are terminated after practice sessions.

---

### **Step 1: AWS Key Pair Setup**

We begin by creating a **key pair** for SSH access to the instances. A key pair consists of:
1. **Public key**: Stored on the AWS server.
2. **Private key**: Stored locally to connect to the server.

#### **Steps:**
1. Navigate to the **AWS EC2 dashboard** in the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Click **Key Pairs** → **Create Key Pair**.
3. Name the key pair (e.g., `Ansible`) and leave the defaults:
   - **Type**: RSA
   - **Format**: `.pem`
4. Save the `.pem` file securely. You’ll need it to SSH into instances.

> **Example Command:** If you lose the key, you can’t connect to the instances directly unless you manually replace the SSH key. Always back it up.

---

### **Step 2: Creating AWS Access Keys**

An **access key** provides API access to your AWS account for automation.

#### **Steps:**
1. Go to **Account Settings** → **Security Credentials**.
2. Scroll to **Access Keys** → **Create Access Key**.
3. Select **Other** as the purpose, name it (e.g., `Ansible`), and click **Create**.
4. **Save the Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** immediately.

> **Security Tip**: Never share access keys publicly. Use environment variables or encrypted secret management tools to store them.

---

### **Step 3: Verify and Configure Default VPC**

AWS provides a **Default VPC** for most accounts. A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) enables isolated networking for your instances.

#### **Steps to Recreate Default VPC (if missing):**
1. Navigate to the **VPC Dashboard**.
2. Go to **Actions** → **Create Default VPC**.
3. AWS will automatically create:
   - A VPC
   - A default subnet in each Availability Zone (AZ)
   - A default internet gateway

---

### **Step 4: Preparing Ansible for AWS**

To allow Ansible to interact with AWS:
1. Install **Boto** and **Boto3** Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip3 install boto boto3
   ```
2. Configure **environment variables** for the access keys:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

---

### **Step 5: Writing the Ansible Playbook**

The first playbook, `ec2_playbook.yml`, does the following:
1. **Creates a security group** for:
   - SSH (port 22)
   - HTTP (port 80)
2. Uses the **EC2 module** to spin up instances.

#### **Example Playbook:**
```yaml
---
- name: Create AWS EC2 instances
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Create security group
      ec2_group:
        name: ansible-sg
        description: Security group for Ansible-managed instances
        rules:
          - proto: tcp
            ports:
              - 22
              - 80
            cidr_ip: 0.0.0.0/0
```

---

### **Step 6: Running the Playbook**

Run the playbook:
```bash
ansible-playbook ec2_playbook.yml
```

#### **Outcome:**
- A new **security group** named `ansible-sg` will appear in the EC2 dashboard.
- It allows traffic on ports 22 and 80.

---

### **Step 7: Launching EC2 Instances**

The second playbook provisions **20 EC2 instances**:
- **Instance Type**: `t2.micro` (Free Tier eligible)
- **Image ID**: Latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
- **Region**: `us-east-1`

#### **Example Playbook:**
```yaml
---
- name: Launch EC2 instances
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Provision instances
      ec2:
        key_name: ansible
        instance_type: t2.micro
        image: ami-12345678
        count: 20
        region: us-east-1
        assign_public_ip: yes
```

---

### **Dynamic Inventory for AWS**

Dynamic Inventory automates grouping instances by tags or attributes. Ansible includes the **AWS EC2 plugin** to enable this.

#### **Configuration (`aws_ec2.yml`):**
```yaml
plugin: aws_ec2
regions:
  - us-east-1
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags.Name
    prefix: tag_
```

Run the following command to generate inventory:
```bash
ansible-inventory -i aws_ec2.yml --graph
```

---

### **Step 8: Testing Connections**

1. Place the `.pem` file in `~/.ssh/`.
2. Set proper permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 400 ~/.ssh/ansible.pem
   ```
3. Test SSH connectivity:
   ```bash
   ansible all -m ping -i aws_ec2.yml
   ```

---

### **Step 9: Installing and Verifying the Web App**

A playbook installs a simple **Nginx** web application:
1. Updates Red Hat-specific configurations.
2. Verifies accessibility by browsing the public IP of any instance.

---

### **Step 10: Cleaning Up**

The final playbook:
1. Terminates instances by setting their state to **absent**.
2. Deletes the **security group** to avoid charges.

#### **Example Playbook:**
```yaml
---
- name: Terminate instances
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Terminate EC2 instances
      ec2:
        state: absent
        instance_ids: "{{ ec2.instances }}"
```

---

### **Final Notes**

- **Cost Management**: Always verify the AWS dashboard after practice to ensure no leftover resources.
- **Dynamic Inventory Benefits**: Using AWS tags with dynamic inventory simplifies host targeting and scaling.
- **Next Steps**: In the next video, we’ll explore **Docker with Ansible**.
