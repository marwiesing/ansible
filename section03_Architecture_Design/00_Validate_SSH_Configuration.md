To ensure that similar issues do not occur in other projects, hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and fix the root causes of such problems systematically:

---

### **1. Validate SSH Configuration**
**Problem:** SSH key or connection configuration issues.
**Solution:**
- **Check SSH Key Permissions:**
  Ensure your private key has the correct permissions (`chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
  ```bash
  chmod 600 /home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```
- **Test Manual SSH Connections:**
  Use `ssh` to verify connections manually:
  ```bash
  ssh -i /home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa ansible@<hostname>
  ```
  If you encounter issues:
  - Ensure the `ansible` user exists on the target machine.
  - Verify that the public key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote machine.

---

### **2. Ensure Correct Inventory File**
**Problem:** Mismatch or duplicate variables in the `hosts` inventory file.
**Solution:**
- **Remove Conflicting Variables:**
  In the `[centos:vars]` section, you set `ansible_user=root`, which overrides the user for `centos1`, `centos2`, and `centos3`. This is unnecessary since the `ansible_user=ansible` is already defined for each host.
  
  **Fixed `hosts` File:**
  ```ini
  [all]
  centos1 ansible_host=172.22.0.7 ansible_port=2222 ansible_user=ansible ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa
  centos2 ansible_host=172.22.0.9 ansible_port=22 ansible_user=ansible ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa
  centos3 ansible_host=172.22.0.8 ansible_port=22 ansible_user=ansible ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa

  [control]
  ubuntu-c ansible_connection=local

  [centos]
  centos1
  centos2
  centos3

  [ubuntu]
  ubuntu[1:3]

  [ubuntu:vars]
  ansible_become=true
  ansible_become_pass=password

  [linux:children]
  centos
  ubuntu
  ```

---

### **3. Verify `ansible.cfg`**
**Problem:** Misconfigured or redundant settings in the Ansible configuration.
**Solution:**
- Ensure the configuration aligns with the inventory file:
  - `inventory` points to the correct file.
  - `private_key_file` matches the path used in the inventory.
  - Remove unnecessary `[all]` section.

**Fixed `ansible.cfg`:**
```ini
[defaults]
inventory = hosts
host_key_checking = False
remote_user = ansible
private_key_file = /home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa

[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
pipelining = True
```

---

### **4. Test Ansible Connections**
Run these commands to verify connections:
- **Ping All Hosts:**
  ```bash
  ansible all -m ping -u ansible
  ```
- **Run Setup Module:**
  ```bash
  ansible all -m setup -u ansible
  ```

---

### **5. Use Debugging to Identify Issues**
**Problem:** Still facing connection issues?
**Solution:**
- Add the `-vvv` flag to commands to debug:
  ```bash
  ansible centos1 -m ping -vvv
  ```
- Look for:
  - SSH key issues.
  - Incorrect user or host configuration.
  - Port mismatch or blocked ports.

---

### **6. Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- **Incorrect Ports:** Ensure that ports (e.g., `22` or `2222`) are correctly specified.
- **Duplicate Variables:** Avoid variable duplication or conflict in inventory files.
- **Key Issues:** Ensure public keys are added to remote hosts, and permissions are correctly set.

---

### **7. Automate Key Deployment (Optional)**
If you frequently add new hosts, consider using `ssh-copy-id` to deploy public keys:
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i /home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ansible@<hostname>
```

---

### Final Steps
Once everything is working:
1. Save your inventory and configuration files for future reuse.
2. Document host-specific settings for easy debugging later.
