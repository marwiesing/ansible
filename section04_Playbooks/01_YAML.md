Let’s start by understanding YAML.

### YAML: A Data-Oriented Language

**What is YAML?**
YAML ("YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data serialization standard often used for configuration files. It’s lightweight, structured, and integrates seamlessly with Python and Ansible.

#### **Core Principles of YAML**
- **Indentation**: YAML uses indentation to denote structure, with two spaces as a common convention (no tabs allowed).
- **Comments**: Begin with `#`. These are ignored by the YAML interpreter but help document your file.
- **Quotes**: Single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes can encapsulate strings, but they are optional unless special characters are involved.

#### **YAML Elements**
1. **Key-Value Pairs**:
   ```yaml
   example_key_1: "This is a string"
   example_key_2: 'This is another string'
   ```
   Interpreted in Python as a dictionary:
   ```python
   {
       "example_key_1": "This is a string",
       "example_key_2": "This is another string"
   }
   ```
2. **Lists**:
   ```yaml
   items:
     - item1
     - item2
     - item3
   ```
   Python equivalent:
   ```python
   {"items": ["item1", "item2", "item3"]}
   ```
3. **Multiline Values**:
   - **Preserve Line Breaks**:
     ```yaml
     description: |
       This is line one.
       This is line two.
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     "This is line one.\nThis is line two."
     ```
   - **Fold into One Line**:
     ```yaml
     description: >
       This is line one.
       This is line two.
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     "This is line one. This is line two."
     ```

4. **Booleans and Integers**:
   - True/False values:
     ```yaml
     enabled: true
     disabled: false
     ```
   - YAML’s flexible interpretation:
     ```yaml
     # False equivalents:
     - false
     - no
     - off
     - 0
     ```
     Be cautious with ambiguous values like `y` or `n`. While valid in Ansible, they can cause confusion.

5. **Dictionaries within Dictionaries**:
   ```yaml
   server:
     name: "example-server"
     ip: "192.168.1.1"
   ```
   Interpreted in Python as:
   ```python
   {
       "server": {
           "name": "example-server",
           "ip": "192.168.1.1"
       }
   }
   ```

#### **Validating YAML**
Use tools like `yamllint` to ensure correctness. YAML is sensitive to indentation errors and structural inconsistencies.

### Hands-On: YAML with Python Utility
We’ll use a Python script (`show_yaml_python`) to load and pretty-print YAML files:

```python
import yaml
from pprint import pprint

with open("test.yaml", "r") as file:
    data = yaml.load(file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)
    pprint(data)
```

#### Example Workflows

**Revision 01**: Start with an empty YAML file.
- File: `test.yaml`
  ```yaml
  # YAML start and end markers
  ---
  ...
  ```
  Output: `None` (no data).

**Revision 02**: Add key-value pairs.
- File:
  ```yaml
  key1: "value1"
  key2: "value2"
  ```
  Output: Python dictionary with keys and values.

**Revision 03**: Experiment with quotes.
- File:
  ```yaml
  no_quotes: unquoted
  single_quotes: 'quoted'
  double_quotes: "quoted"
  ```
  All values are treated equivalently in Python.

**Revision 04**: Handle escape sequences.
- File:
  ```yaml
  escaped: "Line one\nLine two"
  ```
  Double quotes are essential for interpreting `\n` as a newline.

**Revision 05-07**: Multiline strings.
- Use `|` for preserved line breaks and `>` for folded lines.
- Example with trimmed trailing newline:
  ```yaml
  folded: >-
    This is line one.
    This is line two.
  ```

### Challenge: Building a YAML File
1. **Create a List**:
   ```yaml
   manufacturers:
     - Aston Martin
     - Fiat
     - Ford
     - Vauxhall
   ```

2. **Convert List to Dictionaries**:
   ```yaml
   manufacturers:
     - name: "Aston Martin"
     - name: "Fiat"
     - name: "Ford"
     - name: "Vauxhall"
   ```

3. **Add Additional Keys**:
   ```yaml
   manufacturers:
     - name: "Aston Martin"
       year_founded: 1913
       website: "astonmartin.com"
     - name: "Fiat"
       year_founded: 1899
       website: "fiat.com"
   ```

4. **Include Founders**:
   ```yaml
   manufacturers:
     - name: "Aston Martin"
       year_founded: 1913
       website: "astonmartin.com"
       founded_by:
         - Lionel Martin
         - Robert Mamford
     - name: "Fiat"
       year_founded: 1899
       website: "fiat.com"
       founded_by:
         - Giovanni Agnelli
   ```

### YAML Best Practices
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces preferred).
- Stick to clear boolean values (`true`/`false`).
- Add comments for clarity.
- Validate YAML files using `yamllint` or similar tools.
